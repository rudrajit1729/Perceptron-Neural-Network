# Perceptron-Neural-Network
Creating a simple neural network from scratch with one input layer(3 inputs) and one output neuron.

Perceptron -  A neural network with no hidden layers.

# What does it do?
The neural_net.py tries to predict the output given 3 binary inputs. If the first input is 1, the output should be one. Otherwise the output should be 0.

Run *neural_net.py* to see the neural network prediction in action.
